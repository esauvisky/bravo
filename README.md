Bravi Assessment Test
=====================

### Disclaimer

>*I've never used docker before, though I took the challenge — **at the expense of maybe failing the test** — just for the sake of learning. It looked like such a ridiculously useful tool, that I'm certain I'll continue to make use of it in my future projects, regardless of whether I pass this test or not. Keep in mind that I'm quite aware that the way I set it up for this project may look a bit funky, but that's to be expected as I'm still in the beggining of docker's learning curve.*

>*On the other hand, though, if anything regarding Wordpress looks a bit funky, well... that's simply because it's Wordpress.*

## Requirements

- `docker`

- `docker-compose`

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the directory.

2. Run the docker application:

        docker-compose up -d

3. Open your browser and point it to `localhost`<sup>[[1]](#footnote1)</sup>.

4. Profit. *I mean, Bravo!*

## Here are some suggestions to get you started

- Log in as `admin:admin`

- Log in as `user:user`

- Try UX from a mobile viewport

- Try cheating!

    - Open the [search page](http://localhost/search/) while not logged in — directly via the URL —, see if it works <sup>[[2]](#footnote2)</sup>.

## Remarks and TODOs

- I've never used the theme Hetia(https://wordpress.org/themes/hestia/) before. I deliberately chose a random theme as a *proof-of-concept* that my solution would be robust enough to be suitable for any theme.

- Though this implementation works, it **will never** scale properly without proper caching of — *at the very least* — the poster images.

- Things that are missing and/or could've been done better:

    1. OMDB API parameter *By search* returns paginated JSONs, which **was not implemented on the search page**, so you'll only get 10 results max per search.

    2. You can only **add** movies to your favorites, not remove them. To be fair, the assessment test did not explicitely specified that you should be able to remove a movie from your favorites. Nevertheless, it's easy to implement on `bravo_add_fav()` with a few changes on the .js to turn it into a toggle button.

    3. Sometimes OMDB returns posters images URLs that do not exist (404), and that gets passed on into the Search and My Favorites pages. A simple check for this along a placeholder image for "Poster Not Available" would suffice to fix this issue.

    4. I could have used AJAX on the pagination of My Favorites page as well.

## Foot-Notes

<a name="footnote1">1</a>. If you're already running anything on port 80, you can map a different port by editing the file `docker-compose.yml`.

<a name="footnote2">2</a>. If you open any "Private" page without the correct permissions, Wordpress' default behaviour is to 404 on you. The proper way to solve it and give you control over what'll be displayed — e.g.: an alternative login page — would be to create a custom page template that handles the verification of whether the user is logged in or not, and use it as the template of the page(s) you're trying to restrict access. Setting pages as Private is much simpler and works perfectly fine, but it's definitely a workaround, which in the long run could get messy, particularly if you have lots of pages to restrict access to.
